# Sherpago

Sherpago reads the (machine-readable) documentation for a [sherpa API](https://www.ueber.net/who/mjl/sherpa/) as generated by sherpadoc, and outputs a documented Go package with a client with all functions and types from the sherpa documentation.  Example:

	# Fetch the API description as sherpadoc.
	# The author of the API probably used "sherpadoc MyAPI" to generate this documentation.
	curl https://example.org/myapi/_docs >myapi.json

	# Turn the sherpadoc into a Go client library.
	sherpago MyAPI https://example.org/myapi/ < myapi.json > myapi.go
	gofmt -w myapi.go

# TODO

- write tests
- either return error message or use another name when we get duplicate identifiers (type or field or function names) after turning a name from sherpadoc into a proper Go identifier. currently we generate Go code that won't compile.
- reformat comments, turning markdown from sherpadoc into more readable Go comments. e.g. turn bullet lists into indented wrapped text.
- add top-level documentation. something generic for the object named apiName, and the actual top-level sherpadoc text as package-level docs.
- sync with sherpats, code was shared between them.
